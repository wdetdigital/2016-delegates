# 2016-delegates
Charting delegates won by candidates and states during the 2016 primaries using Highcharts.js.

## Hosting and posting
These graphs were created for WDET's feature <a href="http://wdet.org/posts/2016/03/07/82635-track-the-presidential-delegates-graph/">Track the Presidential Delegates.</a>

WDET posts are created using a text editor, making loading external javascript libraries (like highcharts) to the page challenging. As a work around, <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">JSFiddle</a> is an easy tool for running our code and embedding only the result via an iframe.
